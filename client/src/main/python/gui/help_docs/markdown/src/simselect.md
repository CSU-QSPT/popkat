To select a simulation, highlight or scroll in the *My Simulations* or
*Sample simulations* grid.

The *Search term* field can be used to narrow the number of selections using either
text or a regular expression.

Information about the selected simulation will be shown in the *Simulation details*
area of the screen.

You may delete a simulation in the *My Simulations* grid by right clicking on a line in the grid and selecting *Delete simulation*. **WARNING: This action cannot be undone.**
