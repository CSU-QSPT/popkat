## Setting model parameters

A model parameter's *value* and *notes* can be changed by double clicking in their respective fields and typing in a value (or distribution when relevant).

Model parameters can be narrowed by entering text or a regular expression into the *Search for parameters* field.

The *notes* field can be used to record and meta-information about the value, e.g., the literature citation for the value.

For a *parameter estimation* simulation, place an 'X' next to an item if you would like that item estimated. The value (or distribution) you enter into the 'value' field will be the Bayesian prior for that parameter.

Possible distributions for a given parameter are as follows:
